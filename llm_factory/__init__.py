# This file makes Python treat the `llm_factory` directory as a package.

# You can optionally import key classes/functions here for easier access
# from .main import main

# from .inference.vllm_engine import VLLMEngine

# Initialize logging when the package is imported?
# Generally, it's better to let the application (main.py) initialize logging.
# from .utils.logging_setup import setup_logging
# setup_logging() # Calling this here might have side effects if not desired.
